# Python-Class-STEAM-Clown
This is my "New" repository of my STEAM Clown - Mechatronics Engineering Python Coding Class.  This is where I'm going to move all my class labs and coding examples.

Much of the class Lectures, Examples and Labs are modification of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) by Al Sweigart and [Python for Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/) by Chuck Severance

My [STEAM Clown - Mechatronics Engineering Python Google Site](https://sites.google.com/view/steam-clown-mechatronics/mechatronics-engineering/units/unit-8-python-programming-iot-page) is where I have links to Google Slide Lectures and other classroom resources.  It's a complete wreck, disorganized mess right now, but heres hoping to make this better during the summer of 2025.
