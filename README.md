# Python-Class-STEAM-Clown
This is my "New" repository of my STEAM Clown - Mechatronics Engineering Python Coding Class.  This is where I'm going to move all my class labs and coding examples.

Much of this class and the examples and labs are modification of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) by Al Sweigart and [Python for Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/) by Chuck Severance

My [STEAM Clown - Mechatronics Engineering Python Google Site](https://sites.google.com/view/steam-clown-mechatronics/mechatronics-engineering/units/unit-8-python-programming-iot-page) is where I have links to Google Slide Lectures and other classroom resources.  It's a complete wreck, disorganized mess right now, but heres hoping to make this better during the summer of 2025.

## Chapter 0 - Python Introduction

## Chapter 1 - ??

## Chapter 9 - Reading & Writing Files
1) Lab 1 - Parts of a file handle - 
2) Lab 2 - Opening a file -
